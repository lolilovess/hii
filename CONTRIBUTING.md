# 🏁 contributing to the empire

hi! if you want to add a stitch to this archive, you must follow the **ivory laws**. 🍦

### 📜 the laws
1. **strictly no #ffffff**: all backgrounds must be ivory (`#f3efe0`).
2. **strictly sturdy**: all borders must be at least `2px` and rounded to `22px` or more.
3. **character integrity**: themes must work with the Black and White character. 
4. **carefree logic**: use lowercase for descriptions and keep the energy relaxed.

### 🛠️ pull requests
if your code is "pritti" and follows the tension rules, it will be merged into the archive. 🧶
